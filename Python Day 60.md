*   **Topic:** Mastering control flow.
*   **Review:** Recap conditionals and loops.
*   **Project 2: Number Guessing Game**
    *   The program picks a random number between 1 and 100.
    *   The user has a limited number of guesses.
    *   Use a loop to manage guesses and `if/elif/else` to give hints ("too high" or "too low").
